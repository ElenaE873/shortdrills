# shortdrills

1 - "master" Branch:
This branch contains more developed and/or customized short scripts.

Try this fun "women of science" simple loop script called "Prompt_Loop_Script - Lists, Conditionals, Loops"

The Dictionaries and SubDictionaries script just shows you can truly build master libraries through Dictionaries (and lists turned dictionaries) and how they would be retrieved; simple yet fundamental.

One more user input prompt loop script just for fun with movies, this time :). See the "Dictionaries & Loops_multiple conditions" script.

The Question&Answer loop is a simple loop you can get started with to get a questions and answer sequence to loop through knowing one outcome may only be inevitable if build this way, but it can be expanded and built upon.

2 - "scriptdrills" Branch:
This branch contains really basic and simple .py scripts.
